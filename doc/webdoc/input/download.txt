**CAUTION** URL begins with *https*, not http.

Requirements
============

MUDA compiler **mudah** is written totally in Haskell.

To build MUDA compiler, You'll need Haskell compiler, especially GHC.
You can grab GHC from http://www.haskell.org/ghc/

Supported platform
==================

MUDA compiler may works any platform where Haskell compiler GHC works(e.g. Linux, Win32, Mac OS X, BSD, etc).

MUDA genrated SIMD-C code may be compiled on following platforms.

* x86/SSE backend

  - HW: CPUs which supports SSE2.
  - Compilers:
  
    - gcc, which supports **-msse2** compiler option.
    - icc, cl(Visual C++)

* LLVM IR backend

  - TODO

* PPC/AltiVec backend

  - TODO

After checking out MUDA source tree from above svn repository, type following

::

  $ cd muda
  $ make

  # MUDA compiler named 'mudah' is built at top directory.

  $ make test  <- this is optional
  

Let's try!
